<p>As you know my name is Logan Freeman and I go to ISU and CTK is my major. The things that I enjoy doing are hanging with friends, playing games whether physical or digital, playing instruments, and listening to music.  The games I enjoy are Destiny 2, Secret Hitler, Fortnite, Death May Die: Cthulhu (Board Game), and Rainbow Six. My favorite instrument is the guitar, specifically acoustic and I own 3 of them. Here are two photos of friends like I enjoy hanging out with. The image to the left is a photo of my girlfriend, Jess, and I trying on our Halloween costumes. The image on the right is a photo of my friend Jerry and I at Disney Springs. </p>
