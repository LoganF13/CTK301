<p>Here are some of my completed projects for the semester. These first three are from my digital illustration course. The first illustration is of a Druid wild-shaped into a bear, the second illustration is of the great Cthulhu, and the third is of one of my custom DnD bosses named The Taken. </p>

<p>This next project is from my graphic design course. It's a video about words doing their own actions. I would have liked to include more of the videos that I have made this semester, like my story about a bear attempting to make friends or my Five Nights at Freddy's inspired horror short film, but unfortunately the files were all too large.</p>
